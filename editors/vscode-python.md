*Python* is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose language supporting object-oriented programming with more emphasis on code-readibility and extensibility. A complete guide to install and configure Python via Anaconda/Miniconda Distribution can be found in [this link](https://github.com/Sampreet/install-guides/blob/master/languages/python/python-anaconda-miniconda.md).

### Visual Studio Code

*Visual Studio Code* (VSCode) is an open-source, highly-customizable and versatile source-code editor developed by Microsoft which supports debugging, version control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. Download the appropriate setup file for your operating system (Windows/Linux/MacOSX) from the [official page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install. Easy!

### Microsoft's Python Extension

*Python* extension for VSCode by Microsoft provides a rich support for the language including a whole bundle of features for easy execution of Python scripts. Install the latest version of this extension from VSCode's Marketplace, the last icon on VSCode's *activity bar* (left edge). It usaully stays at the top with nearly 20M downloads:

Once the installation is complete, reload VSCode for the changes to take effect.

## Testing

Open any folder containing Python scripts.

Alternatively, create a ```.py``` file (say, ```helloworld.py```) inside VSCode and add the following line:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Save the file inside a folder (say, ```test```). Now, on the file explorer on VSCode's *side bar* (second-from-left panel), click on the ```.py``` file. The Python extension will load automatically.

### Selecting the Python Environment

Whenever any ```.py``` file is selected, VSCode's Python extension loads automatically. Select the corresponding ```conda``` environment by clicking on the text mentioning the current ```python``` interpreter at the bottom left corner of the VSCode window:

### Running Python Files

Right click the ```.py``` file in the VSCode file explorer to open the context menu. Select ```Run Python File in Terminal```. This will open a new terminal inside VSCode, activate the selected Python environment and execute the file there:

### Opening IPython/Jupyter Notebooks

Create a IPython/Jupyter Notebook file (say, ```notebook.ipynb```) and click on the ```.ipynb``` file in the VSCode file explorer. The Jupyter server will load automatically with all the options to insert/run cells, stop/restart kernel, etc displayed on a top panel. Markdown and Python scripts can be toggled by using the ```Mâ†“``` and ```{}``` options on top of each cell. Hit ```Shift+Enter``` to execute a cell. Python outputs are displayed below the cell upon execution:
